    "# Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of linear regression, the feature (subset) selection methods in the previous section involve using least squares to fit a linear model that contains a subset of the predictors (features/variables). We have seen the large variance of the least squares estimates across different folds in cross validation. This variance is related to the sensitivity of the least squares estimates to small changes in the data, leading to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will see how to reduce this variance by regularising the least squares estimates, i.e. [regularisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)). We can fit a model containing all $D$ predictors using a technique that constrains or regularises the coefficient estimates, or equivalently, that shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero and significantly reduce their variance. The two best-known techniques for shrinking the regression coefficients towards zero, i.e. regularisation, are [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) and the [lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ridge regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from {doc}`Linear regression <../02-linear-reg/overview>` that the least squares fitting procedure estimates $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_D$ by minimising the [residual sum of squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares) (RSS) on the training data:\n",

The term $\\lambda \\sum_{d=1}^D \\beta_d^2$ is called a _regularisation term_ (or _shrinkage penalty_), because it regularises (shrinks) the coefficient estimates towards zero. The tuning parameter $\\lambda$ controls the amount of shrinkage: for large values of $\\lambda$, the coefficients are very strongly shrunk towards zero, whereas for small values of $\\lambda$, the coefficients are barely shrunk at all. In the limit as $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$, ridge regression recovers the least squares estimates, i.e. degenerated to linear regression without regularisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the regularisation term in ridge regression has the effect of shrinking the coefficient estimates $\\beta_d$ for all $d$, but it has no effect on $\\beta_0$. This is because the penalty only includes the sum of squares of the $\\beta_d$, not the $\\beta_0$. In other words, the penalty has no effect on the intercept. This is a desirable property, since we usually do not want to regularise the intercept.\n",

    "Ridge regression’s advantage over least squares is that it can alleviate overfitting, which is rooted in the bias-variance trade-off. As $\\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias. In other words, ridge regression reduces the variance of the least squares estimates, but at the expense of increasing the bias. As shown in the figure above, for values of $\\lambda$ up to about 10, the MSE drops as $\\lambda$ increases. Beyond this point, the MSE increases considerably. This is because the bias introduced by ridge regression becomes too large, and the model becomes too rigid to to capture the true relationship between the predictors and the response. \n",

This means that a small change in the training data can cause a large change in the least squares coefficient estimates. In particular, when the number of variables $D$ is almost as large as the number of observations $N$, the least squares estimates will be extremely variable. And if $D > N$, then the least squares estimates do not even have a unique solution, whereas ridge regression can still perform well by trading oﬀ a small increase in bias for a large decrease in variance. Hence, _ridge regression works best in situations where the least squares estimates have high variance_.\n",

    "Ridge regression also has substantial computational advantages over best subset selection, which requires searching through $2^D$ models. As we discussed previously, even for moderate values of $D$, such a search can be computationally infeasible. In contrast, for any fixed value of $\\lambda$, ridge regression only fits a single model, and the model-fitting procedure can be performed quite quickly. In fact, one can show that the computations required to a ridge regression model, simultaneously for all values of $\\lambda$, are almost identical to those for fitting a model using least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression does have one obvious disadvantage. Unlike best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise selection, which will generally select models that involve just a subset of the variables, ridge regression will include all $D$ predictors in the final model. The penalty $\\lambda \\sum_{d=1}^D \\beta_d^2$ will shrink all of the coefficients towards zero, but it will not set any of them exactly to zero (unless $\\lambda$ = ∞). This may not be a problem for prediction accuracy, but it can create a challenge in model interpretation in settings when the number of variables $D$ is quite large."

The least squares solution is marked as $\\hat{\\beta}$ while the blue diamond and circle represent the lasso and ridge regression constraints, respectively. If $t$ is sufficiently large, then the constraint regions will contain $\\hat{\\beta}$, and so the ridge regression and lasso estimates will be the same as the least squares estimates. (Such a large value of $t$ corresponds to $\\lambda = 0 $ in\n",
    "Equation {eq}`ridge-regression1` and Equation {eq}`lasso1`.) However, in {numref}`l2-l1`, $t$ is not large enough so the least squares estimates lie outside of the diamond and the circle, and the least squares estimates are not the same as the lasso and ridge regression estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the ellipses centred around $\\hat{\\beta}$ represents a contour: this means that all of the points on a particular ellipse have the same RSS value. As the ellipses expand away from the least squares coefficient estimates, the RSS increases. Equations {eq}`lasso2` and {eq}`ridge-regression2` indicate that the lasso and ridge regression coefficient estimates are given by the first point at which an ellipse contacts the constraint region. Since ridge regression has a circular constraint with no sharp points, this intersection will not generally occur on an axis, and so the ridge regression coefficient estimates will be exclusively non-zero. However, the lasso constraint has corners at each of the axes, and so the ellipse will often intersect the constraint region at an axis. When this occurs, one of the coefficients will equal to zero. For example, in {numref}`l2-l1`, the intersection occurs at $\\beta_1 = 0$, and so the resulting model will only include $\\beta_2$. In higher dimensions, many of the coefficient estimates may equal to zero simultaneously. This is the reason why the lasso results in some coefficient estimates that are exactly equal to zero.  "

    "## Comparing the lasso and ridge regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that the lasso has a major advantage over ridge regression, in that it produces simpler and more interpretable models that involve only a subset of the predictors. However, which method leads to better prediction accuracy? By comparing the test MSEs in [Ridge regression](#Ridge-regression) and [Lasso](#Lasso), we can see that the lasso leads to a similar behaviour to ridge regression, while the minimum MSE of ridge regression is slightly smaller than that of the lasso. However, if the response variable is only correlated with a small subset of the predictors, then the lasso will perform better than ridge regression. This is because the lasso will set the coefficients of the irrelevant predictors to zero, whereas ridge regression will shrink them towards zero but not set them exactly to zero. In this case, the lasso will perform better because it will result in a model that involves only the relevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, one might expect the lasso to perform better in a setting where a relatively small number of predictors have substantial coefficients, and the remaining predictors have coefficients that are very small or equal to zero. Ridge regression will perform better when the response is a function of many predictors, all with coefficients of roughly equal size. However, the number of predictors that is related to the response is never known a priori for real datasets. A technique such as cross-validation can be used to determine which approach is better on a particular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- As with ridge regression, when the least squares estimates have excessively high variance, the lasso solution can yield a reduction in variance at the expense of a small increase in bias, and consequently can generate more accurate predictions. Unlike ridge regression, the lasso performs variable selection, and hence results in models that are easier to interpret.  -->"
