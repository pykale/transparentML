## Summary
In traditional machine learning, feature selection is a core part of the process to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. In fact, feature selection can help improve the transparency of a machine learning model since it tells us what the model finds important. In some cases, the selected features be cross-checked with domain experts, such as in clinical settings. Furthermore, we also learned about how regularisation can help prevent overfitting and improve your models.

In this topic, you learnt:
- Methods of feature selection.
- How to regularise linear models.
