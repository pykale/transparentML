    "# Convolutional neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "[Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for images, in computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The main idea behind CNNs is to use a _convolutional layer_ to extract features from the image locally. The convolutional layer is typically followed by a _pooling layer_ to reduce the dimensionality. The convolutional and pooling layers are then followed by one or more _fully connected layers_, e.g. to classify the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "On 30 September 2012, a CNN called [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) (click to view the architecture) achieved a top-5 error of 15.3% in the [ImageNet Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet#ImageNet_Challenge), more than **10.8 percentage** points lower than that of the runner up. This is considered a breakthrough and has grabbed the attention of increasing number of researchers, practitioners, and the general public. Since then, deep learning has penetrated to many research and application areas. AlexNet contained **eight layers**. In 2015, it was outperformed by a very deep CNN with **over 100 layers** from Microsoft in the ImageNet 2015 contest.\n",

    "## Why convolutional neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous section](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/10-deep-cnn-rnn/multilayer-nn.html), we used fully connected neural networks to classify digit images, where the input image needs to be _flattened_ into a vector. There are two major drawbacks of using fully connected neural networks for image classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of parameters in the fully connected layer can be very large. For example, if the input image is $28\\times 28$ pixels (MNIST), then the number of weights for each hidden unit in the fully connected layer is $28\\times 28 = 784$. If the number of hidden units in the fully connected layer is 100, then the number of weight parameters in the fully connected layer is $784\\times 100 = 78,400$, for a total of $78,400 + 100 = 78,500$ parameters (there are 100 bias parameters). If we have an input image of a larger size $224\\times 224$ pixels, then the total number of parameters in the fully connected layer with 100 hidden units is $224\\times 224 \\times 100 + 100 = 5,017,700$. This is a lot of parameters to learn and to compute the output once the network is trained. \n",
    "- Fully connected neural networks do not make use of the spatial structure of the image. Moreover, a small shift in the position of the image can result in a very different input vector and thus the output of the network can be quite different. This is not desirable for image classification. For image classification, we hope to utilise and preserve the spatial information of the image. This is where convolutional neural networks come in. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key ideas behind convolutional neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local connectivity**: The convolutional layer is only connected to a small region of the input. This allows the convolutional layer to learn local features using only a small number of parameters.\n",
    "- **Weight sharing**: The weights in the convolutional layer are shared across the entire input to detect the same local feature at different locations, across the entire input. This greatly reduces the number of parameters to learn."
