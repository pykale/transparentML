    "# Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is a resampling method that is commonly used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model and subsequently select the appropriate level of flexibility of the given model or the best model from a set of candidate models. The process of evaluating a model’s performance is known as _model assessment_, whereas the process of selecting the proper level of flexibility for a model is known as [model selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection).\n",
    "\n",
    "One round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set). To reduce variability, multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are averaged over the rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a machine learning model may be evaluated by splitting the available data into a training set and a test set. The model is then trained on the training set, and its performance is measured on the test set. However, the evaluation procedure can have a high variance, depending on exactly which observations are included in the training set and which observations are included in the test set. Cross-validation remedies this problem by averaging the results over several complementary test sets and training sets. The method is called cross-validation because it involves training and testing the method on different subsets of the original data, where the subsets are different from each other in that the training sets are disjoint from the test sets. The method is also called _rotation estimation_ because it can be thought of as a form of rotation among the available data.\n",

    "<!-- Using [Polynomial](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/preprocessing.html#generating-polynomial-features) feature generation in scikit-learn -->\n",
    "The validation set approach is a strategy to estimate the _test error_ associated with fitting a particular model on a set of observations. It involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts, a _training set_ and a _validation set_ or _hold-out set_. The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the \"unseen\" (hold-out) observations in the validation set. The resulting validation set error rate, e.g. mean squared error (MSE) for a quantitative response, provides an _estimate_ of the test error rate.\n",

    "In the following example, we study linear regression on the [Auto dataset](https://github.com/pykale/transparentML/blob/main/data/Auto.csv). In [Linear regression](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/02-linear-reg/extension-limitation.html#nonlinear-relationships), we discovered a [nonlinear relationship](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/02-linear-reg/extension-limitation.html#nonlinear-relationships) between `mpg` and `horsepower`. Compared to using only a linear term, a model that using `horsepower` and `horsepower`$^2$ gives better results in predicts `mpg`. Can we tell what kind of nonlinear relationship between `mpg` and `horsepower` will give the best prediction performance?\n",

    "We will use the validation set approach to estimate the test errors associated with different degrees (1 to 10) of polynomial expansion capturing different nonlinear relationships. We can randomly split the 392 observations of the `Auto` dataset into two sets, a training set containing 196 of the data points for model training, and a validation set containing the remaining 196 observations for evaluating by MSE. We will use the [`train_test_split()` function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) from the `sklearn.model_selection` library to randomly split the data into two sets."

    "[Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#Leave-one-out_cross-validation) is closely related to the validation set approach. It also splits the set of observations into two parts. However, instead of creating two subsets of comparable size, a single observation $(\\mathbf{x}_i , y_i)$, where $ i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N $, is used for the validation set, and the remaining observations $\\{(\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), (\\mathbf{x}_2, y_2), \\cdots, (\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}, y_{i-1}), (\\mathbf{x}_{i+1}, y_{i+1}), \\cdots, (\\mathbf{x}_N , y_N)\\}$ make up the training set. The machine learning model is fit on the $ N − 1 $ training observations, and a prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ is made for the excluded observation, using its value $\\mathbf{x}_i$. \n",
    "Since $(\\mathbf{x}_i , y_i)$ was not used in the fitting process, the squared test error $ \\epsilon_i = (y_i − \\hat{y}_i)^2 $ provides an approximately unbiased estimate. \n",
    "<!-- But even though MSE 1 is unbiased for the test error, it is a poor estimate because it is highly variable, since it is based upon a single observation (x 1 , y 1 ). -->\n",
    "\n",
    "We can repeat the procedure by iterating $i$ from $1$ to $N$ to produce $N$ squared errors, $ \\epsilon_i, \\dots, \\epsilon_N $. The LOOCV estimate for the test MSE is the average of these $N$ test error estimates:\n",

    "Compared to the validation set approach, LOOCV has the following advantages:\n",
    "- LOOCV has far less bias. In LOOCV, we repeatedly fit the machine learning model using training sets that contain $N − 1$ observations, almost as many as are in the entire dataset. This is in contrast to the validation set approach, in which the training set is typically around half the size of the original dataset. Consequently, the LOOCV approach tends not to overestimate the test error rate as much as the validation set approach does. \n",
    "- In contrast to the validation set approach which will yield different results when applied repeatedly due to randomness in the training/validation set splits, performing LOOCV multiple times will _always yield the same results_: there is _no randomness_ in the training/validation set splits.\n",

    "LOOCV can be viewed as a special case of $K$-fold CV in which $K = N$. In practice, one typically performs $K$-fold CV using $K = 5$ or $K = 10$. The most obvious advantage is computational. LOOCV requires fitting the machine learning model $N$ times. This has the potential to be computationally expensive so may be feasible only for computationally efficient models. But cross-validation is a very general approach that can be applied to almost any machine learning model. Some machine learning models have computationally intensive fitting procedures, and so performing LOOCV may pose computational problems, especially if $N$ is extremely large. In contrast, performing 10-fold CV requires fitting the learning procedure only ten times, which may be much more feasible.\n",
