    "\n",
    "This section introduces [principal component analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). PCA is a popular method for reducing the dimensionality of data, often represented as a data matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times N}$, where $N$ is the number of observations and $D$ is the number of variables (features). When faced with a large set of potentially correlated variables, PCA allows us to summarise this set with a smaller number of representative variables that collectively explain most of the variability in the original set. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Thus, PCA is also a popular method for visualising high-dimensional data, and for imputing missing values in data matrices. -->\n",
    "<!-- The first principal component direction of the data is that along which the observations vary the most. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- PCA refers to the process by which principal components are computed, and the subsequent use of these components in understanding the data. -->\n",
    "PCA is an unsupervised method, since it involves only a set of $D$ features $x_1, \\ldots, x_D$ and no associated response $y$. PCA is a standard [feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction) or [feautre/representation learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning) that is often used as a pre-processing step to reduce the feature dimensionality for supervised learning problems. PCA also serves as a standard tool for [data visualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization), for visualising either observations or features. It can also be used as a factorisation model for data imputation, i.e. for filling in missing values in a data matrix.\n",

    "## PCA for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to visualise observations with measurements on a set of $ D $ features, $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_D $, as part of an [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis). We could do this by examining two-dimensional scatterplots of the data, each of which contains the $N$ observationsâ€™ measurements on two of the features. However, there are $ D(D-1)/2 $ such scatterplots, and it is difficult to visualise more than a few of them at a time even for a $D$ of small value (e.g. if $D=10$, then $ D(D-1)/2 = 45 $). If $ D $ is large, then it will certainly not be possible to look at all of them; moreover, most likely none of them will be informative since they each contain just a small fraction of the total information present in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, a better method is needed to visualise the $N$ observations when $D$ is large. In particular, we would like to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the information as possible. For instance, if we can obtain a two-dimensional representation of the data that captures most of the information, then we can plot the observations in this lower-dimensional space to gain a visual understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA provides a tool to do just this. It finds a lower-dimensional representation of a dataset that contains as much as possible of the variation. The idea is that each of the $N$ observations lives in $D$-dimensional space, but not all of these dimensions are equally interesting. PCA seeks a small number of dimensions that are as interesting as possible, where the concept of interesting is measured by the amount that the observations vary along each dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Principal components (PCs)\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- We now explain the manner in which these dimensions, named as _principal components_, are found. -->\n",
    "Each of the dimensions found by PCA is called a principal component (PC), and it is a linear combination of the $D$ features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first PC of a set of features $x_1, \\ldots, x_D$ is the normalised linear combination of the features\n",

    "that has the largest variance. By normalised, we mean that $ \\sum_{d=1}^D \\phi_{d,1}^2 = 1 $ for the first PC $m=1$ and $ \\sum_{d=1}^D \\phi_{d,m}^2 = 1$ for the $m\\text{th}$ PC in general. We refer to the elements $\\phi_{1, 1}, \\ldots, \\phi_{D, 1} $ as the  _loadings_ of the first _principal loading component_. Together, the loadings make up the first _principal component loading vector_, $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_1 = [\\phi_{1,1}, \\ldots, \\phi_{D,1}]^\\top$. We constrain the loadings so that their sum of squares is equal to one, i.e. normalised, since otherwise setting these elements to be arbitrarily large in absolute value could result in an arbitrarily large variance, giving a trivial solution."

We refer $ y_{1,1}, \\ldots, y_{N,1} $ as the first _principal component scores_. Equation {eq}`eq:1stpc` can be solved via a standard technique in linear algebra, [_eigendecomposition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix) or [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition), as the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$, the one corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, where this eigenvalue is the variance captured in $ \\{y_{n,1}\\}$. The mathematical details of which are beyond the scope of this course. \n",

    "### Interpreting the first PC\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nice geometric interpretation for the first principal component. The loading vector $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_1 $ with elements $ \\phi_{1,1}, \\ldots, \\phi_{D, 1} $ defines a direction in feature space along which the data vary the most. If we project the $N$ data points $\\mathbf{x}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_N$ onto this direction, the projected values are the principal component scores $ y_{1, 1} , \\ldots , y_{N, 1}$ themselves. \n",

    "After the first principal component $ y_{n,1} $ of the features has been determined, we can find the second principal component $ y_{n,2} $. The second principal component is the linear combination of $ x_1 , \\ldots, x_D $ that has maximal variance out of all linear combinations that are uncorrelated with $ y_1 $. The second principal component scores $ y_{1,2}, y_{2,2}, \\ldots , y_{N,2}$ take the form\n",

    "\n",
    "where $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_2 = [\\phi_{1,2}, \\ldots, \\phi_{D,2}]^\\top$ is the second principal component loading vector. It turns out that constraining $ \\{y_{n,2}\\} $ to be uncorrelated with $ \\{y_{n,1}\\} $ is equivalent to constraining the direction $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_2 $ to be orthogonal (perpendicular) to the direction $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_1 $. Thus, by (beautiful) linear algebra, $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_2 $ is the second eigenvector of the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$, the one corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue that equals to the variance captured in $ \\{y_{n,2}\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following principal component loading vectors $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_3 $, $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_4 $, and so forth are the third, fourth, and so forth eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^\\top$, the ones corresponding to the third, fourth, and so forth largest eigenvalues. The corresponding principal component scores are $ \\{y_{n,3}\\} $, $ \\{y_{n,4}\\} $, and so forth.\n",

    "### Visualising the principal components\n",
