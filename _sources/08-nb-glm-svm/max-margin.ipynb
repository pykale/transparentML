    "This section introduces the concept of hyperplane and maximum margin classifier, which are the fundamental concepts of support vector machine (SVM). Hyperplanes are used to separate the data points by their class labels. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points. The maximum margin classifier is a special case of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. \n",

In $D > 3$ dimensions, it can be hard to visualise a hyperplane, but the notion of a $(D − 1)$-dimensional flat subspace still applies.\n",

The maximal margin hyperplane is the separating hyperplane for which the margin is margin largest—that is, it is the hyperplane that has the farthest minimum distance to the training observations. We can then classify a test observation based on which side of the maximal margin hyperplane it lies. This is known as the maximal margin classifier. We hope that a classifier that has a large margin on the training data will also have a large margin on the test data, and hence will classify the test observations correctly. \n",

Therefore, $M$ represents the margin of our hyperplane, and the optimisation problem chooses $ \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_D $ to maximise M. This is exactly the definition of the maximal margin hyperplane! The problem {eq}`eq:max-margin-classifier` can be solved efficiently via quadratic programming, but details of this optimisation are outside of the scope of this course."

When $ C $ is very large, the support vector classifier will attempt to maximise the margin, and so it will misclassify very few training observations. When $ C $ is very small, the support vector classifier will attempt to minimise the number of training observations that are misclassified, and so it will have a smaller margin.
