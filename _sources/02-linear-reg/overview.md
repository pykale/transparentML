Linear regression is a fundamental model for regression problems, where we aim to predict a continuous value (i.e. a quantitative response) based on one or more explanatory variables. It is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variable(s) $x$ or $\mathbf{x}$ and the single output variable $y$. Thus, it can be used to understand the relationship between two or more variables. In this chapter, we will learn how to use linear regression to make predictions and understand the relationship between variables. We will learn the basic concepts of linear regression and apply it to real data. We will also learn how to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model and interpret the results.

We will mainly use the [Advertising](https://github.com/pykale/transparentML/blob/main/data/Advertising.csv) data to explain the key ideas underlying linear regression. The `Advertising` dataset contains sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement spends across multiple channels (TV, radio, newspaper) for a single product in a single market. The goal is to predict `sales` revenue based on the advertisement spends.

<!-- By analysing this dataset, we will try to answer the 7 following questions:

1. Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
2. How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?
3. Which media are associated with sales?
4. How large is the association between each medium and sales?
5. How accurately can we predict future sales?
6. Is the relationship linear?
7. Is there synergy among the advertising media? -->

```{admonition} Ingredients
- Input: features of data samples
- Output: target values of data samples
- Model: fit a line (or plane/hyperplane) to the training data and assign the value on the fitted line (or plane/hyperplane) to the test data
  - Hyperparameter(s): None
  - Parameters: the intercept(s) and slope(s) of the fitted line (or plane/hyperplane), also known as the bias(es) and weight(s), respectively
- Loss function: minimise the total distances of the training data points to the fitted line (or plane/hyperplane)
- Learning algorithm: closed-form analytical solution based on linear algebra
```

```{admonition} System transparency
System logic
- Condition to produce certain output: to produce an output $y$, locate this $y$ value on the fitted line (or plane/hyperplane) and then find the corresponding input $x$ (or $\mathbf{x}$) value

<!-- parameters that must be estimated from the data is the same as the number of input variables. The linear regression model is also a linear model, meaning that the model output $y$ is a linear function of the model coefficients `(Î²)`. The linear regression model is a supervised learning model, meaning that it is trained on data that contains the input and output variables that we are interested in modelling. The linear regression model is a predictive modelling problem, meaning that we are interested in using the model to make predictions on new data. The linear regression model is a regression model, meaning that the output variable $y$ is a real value, such as a price or a probability. The linear regression model is a simple model, meaning that it has a small number of parameters, and is easy to interpret. The linear regression model is a closed-form model, meaning that the model can be fit directly without the use of iterative optimization algorithms. The linear regression model is a model that can be used for both regression and classification predictive modelling problems. The linear regression model is a model that can be used for both regression and classification predictive modelling problems. -->
