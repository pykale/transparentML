    "Now we use the [`LinearRegression` class in `scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) to fit a linear regression model, in order to delve into the details of the a model that minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS). The [`.fit()` method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.fit) takes two arguments, the first is the predictor variable and the second is the response variable. The `.fit()` method returns an object that contains the estimated coefficients. The model generates the fit by minimizing the RSS between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. The `.intercept_` and `.coef_` attributes of the fitted model can be used to obtain the estimated intercept ($\\beta_0$) and slope ($\\beta_1$) of the regression line. \n",

Before fitting, we centre the data by subtracting the mean of each variable from each observation via a [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html). This is a common practice in machine learning called [data normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling), and essentially makes it easier for our model to learn from the data."

The coefficient estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ are only estimates of the true coefficients $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. We can quantify the accuracy of the estimates by computing the [*standard error*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) of the estimates.

The RSE is an estimate of the standard deviation of $\\epsilon$. It is the average amount that the response will deviate from the true regression line, measuring the lack of fit of the model to the data. The smaller the RSE, the better the model fits the data. \n",
